Each folder contains input data and scripts to resemble the respective main figures from the paper.

Note that scripts for the more complex analysis, e.g. enrichment test and read-processing are not included, since they are already published elsewhere or are described in detail in the method section of the paper.

All generated figures are in a raw unpolished style, but resemble the results of the published figures. Although there is no warranty that there are some errors.
For a detailed description of the graphs and methods please check the publication.

Scripts are either bash scripts including Perl commands or R scripts. For scripts from fig4 and fig5 you will need the "ggplot2","agricolae","reshape" and "FSA" package to be installed in R. Usually you would just have to run the shell scripts, they will produce some intermediate files which are then used by the R scripts.

There are sometimes several input files with different extensions, refering to the different datasets (bacteria, fungi, oomycetes). Within the readme files only a general name containing "xxx" is listed.
